# DSA_From_Scratch

This repository is where I implement data structures and algorithms from scratch using C# and .NET.  
I’m doing this to really understand how common structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and sorting algorithms work under the hood — without using built-in collections.

Everything here is handwritten, kept simple, and organized in small projects and classes.  
It’s just my way of practicing low-level problem solving and improving my skills in the .NET world.

Feel free to look around or use any parts for your own practice.
